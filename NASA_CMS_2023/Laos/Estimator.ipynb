    "#####  FEW NOTES ABOUT THE DATAFRAME \"DATA\" READ FROM THE CSV\n",
    "## Ftype: Forest type identified by the team in the field at the sub-plot (or tree-plot) location.\n",
    "## Assigned_Ftype:  Forest type assigned to the plot based on the Ftype of the sub-plots.\n",
    "## Design_SSU_Ftype : Pre-sampling forest-type stratum for each SSU based on the country's forest strata map (extracted using QGIS)\n",
    "## Design_PSU_Ftype : Pre-sampling forest-type stratum for each PSU based on forest strata of the anchor plot (here, I chose \"sub_plotA\" as the anchor plot, \"sub_plotB\" if A was not available...and so on)(extracted using QGIS).\n",
    "## Design_PSU_StrataArea_MAX : The forest stratum that has the largest area (i.e. in m2) in each PSU (extracted using QGIS).\n",

    "## Two correction factors are provided below, but the allometric models must be checked and refit correctly. This script does not perform model refitting.\n",
